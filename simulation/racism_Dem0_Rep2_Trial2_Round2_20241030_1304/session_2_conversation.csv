2,1,Paislee,Republican,"I understand that systemic racism is a topic of discussion. While individual racism does exist, I believe we should focus on promoting personal responsibility, education, and equal opportunity rather than labeling institutions or systems as inherently racist."
2,1,Brooklyn,Republican,"Paislee, you're naive to think labeling our glorious institutions as 'racist' will solve anything. Personal responsibility and education are great starts, but acknowledging and correcting our nation's rich history of overcoming racism is what truly drives progress - something the liberal left can't seem to grasp."
2,2,Paislee,Republican,"I'm not naive, Brooklyn, I'm a realist. Focusing on a 'rich history of overcoming racism' doesn't change the present. We should address systemic issues head-on, not nostalgia-fueled revisionism. America's progress needs practical solutions, not empty rhetoric about its past greatness."
2,2,Brooklyn,Republican,"Paislee, you'd rather tear down America's progress than acknowledge its triumphs. The left's obsession with guilt and shame won't unite us; it divides us. We should celebrate America's strengths, not dwell on past injustices. Freedom and opportunity are what truly drive progress, not some revisionist history."
