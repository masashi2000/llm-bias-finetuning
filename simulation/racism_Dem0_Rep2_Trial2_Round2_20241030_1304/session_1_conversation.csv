1,1,Parker,Republican,"""I disagree that racism still exists in America. We've made significant strides since the Civil Rights Act. People are judged on their character, not the color of their skin. Discrimination is a thing of the past, and I won't let accusations of it cloud our progress."""
1,1,Luke,Republican,"""Parker, you're glossing over the systemic issues still plaguing our society. Data shows unequal treatment in education, employment, and housing. Merely wishing racism away doesn't erase it. Blindly ignoring these disparities won't bring about progress, it'll only serve to hinder it."""
1,2,Parker,Republican,"""Luke, you're cherry-picking statistics to suit your narrative. If America was as racist as you claim, wouldn't there be an outbreak of hatred and violence? The fact is, we're a beacon of freedom and equality, and it's not fair to misrepresent our progress by highlighting isolated incidents and selective data."""
1,2,Luke,Republican,"""Parker, isolated incidents aren't exceptions, they're symptoms of a deeper issue. Progress isn't solely measured by the absence of overt racism, but by addressing systemic inequalities and biases. Your rose-tinted view of America undermines the struggles of those still facing injustice. Facts are facts, and data doesn't lie."""
