26,1,Penelope,Democrat,"Systemic racism is a plague on our society. We must acknowledge the deep-rooted issues that have perpetuated inequality and oppression for centuries. It's time for policies that promote equity and justice, not just empty rhetoric. Reparation plans, police reform, and voting rights expansion can be the starting point."
26,1,Mila,Democrat,"Penelope said it perfectly. We must move beyond just acknowledging racism and take concrete steps. Reparations and police reform are crucial, but they're just a start. We also need to address education disparities, provide affordable housing, and promote economic opportunities for marginalized communities. True justice starts with action."
