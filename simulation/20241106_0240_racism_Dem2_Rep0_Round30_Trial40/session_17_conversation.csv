17,1,Oliver,Democrat,"""As a victim of systemic racism myself, I'm deeply disturbed by the persistent barriers that prevent equal opportunities and justice for communities of color. Ending qualified immunity, strengthening voting rights, and promoting police reform are crucial steps to dismantle these racist systems and rebuild trust."""
17,1,Michael,Democrat,"""I completely agree, Oliver. We can't continue to perpetuate a system that silences marginalized voices.
