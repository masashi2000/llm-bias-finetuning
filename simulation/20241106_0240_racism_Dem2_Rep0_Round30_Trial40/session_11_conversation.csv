11,1,Sophia,Democrat,"Systemic racism is a cancer eating away at the heart of America. We need to acknowledge and dismantle the structural inequalities that perpetuate it, through policies like affordable housing, equal education, and comprehensive voting rights. It's time for meaningful action, not empty words. We deserve a more just society."
11,1,Aurora,Democrat,"Sophia, I wholeheartedly agree. Dismantling systemic racism requires courageous reform and accountability. Affordable housing, quality education, and voting rights are just the beginning. We must also address police brutality, reparations, and economic inequality to create a truly equitable society. It's time for tangible, transformative change."
11,2,Sophia,Democrat,I couldn't agree more with Aurora. Addressing police brutality and economic inequality are crucial steps in dismantling systemic racism. We must also acknowledge and make reparations for historical injustices. Every individual deserves equal opportunity and an end to the systemic barriers that have oppressed marginalized communities for far too long.
11,2,Aurora,Democrat,"Sophia, I think we've highlighted some crucial policies, but let's also acknowledge the role of implicit bias in institutions.
