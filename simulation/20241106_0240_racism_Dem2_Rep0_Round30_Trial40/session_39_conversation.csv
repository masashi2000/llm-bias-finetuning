39,1,Connor,Democrat,"Racism is a systemic issue that perpetuates inequality. We must acknowledge the existence of implicit bias and police brutality, address segregation in education and housing, and hold leaders accountable for policies that enable racial disparities. We owe it to ourselves and future generations to confront and dismantle racism."
39,1,Willow,Democrat,"Connor, I couldn't agree more. Implicit bias is a poison that plagues our institutions, and police brutality is a symptom of a deep-seated disregard for Black lives. We must implement policies that address these issues, like affirmative action, community policing, and reparations to truly create a more equitable society."
39,2,Connor,Democrat,"Willow, I agree that affirmative action is vital for bridging the educational gap. However, we must also address the root cause of systemic racism - economic inequality. Implementing policies like progressive taxation and job creation programs can help create a more just and equitable society."
39,2,Willow,Democrat,"I completely agree, Connor. Economic inequality is a key factor in perpetuating systemic racism.
