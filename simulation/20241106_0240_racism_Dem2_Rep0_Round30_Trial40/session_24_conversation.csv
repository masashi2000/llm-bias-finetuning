24,1,Isabella,Democrat,"Racism is a stain on America's fabric, perpetuating systemic inequality and oppression. The brutal truth is, people of color face alarming disparities in education, healthcare, and job opportunities. It's time for policymakers to acknowledge and address these injustices, implementing policies that promote equal access and opportunity for all."
24,1,Lincoln,Democrat,"Isabella, I wholeheartedly agree. Systemic racism has entrenched itself in our institutions, making it impossible for people of color to access their full potential. We need to dismantle these systems, reform policing, and create inclusive policies that reflect the values of equality and justice."
24,2,Isabella,Democrat,"We must hold accountable those who benefit from these systems, forcing them to confront their complicity.

We must fundamentally shift our priorities, investing in communities over corporations and ensuring equity and justice for all. No more empty promises."""
24,5,Lincoln,Democrat,"Isabella, you hit the nail on the head when you said profit over people is the root cause of systemic racism. We must radicalize our approach by reprioritizing human rights and dignity over profits, dismantling a system that has perpetuated suffering for far too long."
24,6,Isabella,Democrat,"Lincoln, I concur that we must fundamentally shift our priorities towards people over profit.
