28,1,Caleb,Republican,"""I think we're a color-blind society, Caleb. The left's focus on racism is just a way to divide people and gain power. We need to unite around our shared American values, not be held back by the Democrats' narrative of victimhood and division."""
28,1,Aaron,Republican,"I couldn't agree more, Caleb. The American people value fairness and equality, but some on the left would have us believe there's systemic racism. Our focus should be on true injustices, not manufactured ones. We must unite behind our core American values: individual freedom and equal opportunity for all."
28,2,Caleb,Republican,"""That's exactly right, Aaron. The left's narrative of systemic racism is just a smoke screen to undermine our values and divide Americans. It's a myth perpetuated by the likes of MSNBC and CNN, but the American people aren't buying it. We stand for equality, not fake victimhood."""
28,2,Aaron,Republican,"Caleb, I think you hit the nail on the head. The left's obsession with systemic racism is nothing more than a misguided attempt to demonize America. We must not let their narrative of division cloud our vision - we're a beacon of hope and equality for all, no matter the color of our skin."
28,3,Caleb,Republican,"""Couldn't agree more, Aaron. The left's focus on skin color is a distraction from real issues like poverty, education, and crime. We should be discussing how to uplift all Americans, not perpetuating the Democrats' divisive ideology of victimhood and reverse racism."""
28,3,Aaron,Republican,"""I completely agree, we should focus on the real issues, like poverty and education, rather than fueling the left's divisive narrative of systemic racism. That's just a smoke screen for their failed policies and a desperate attempt to blame America for their shortcomings. Fact-based solutions, not emotional appeals."""
28,4,Caleb,Republican,"""I'm disappointed in the lack of evidence-based discussion on this topic. Studies, such as the Thomas Sowell book, demonstrate the myth of systemic racism. Let's focus on facts, not emotional narratives that divide us. We're a color-blind society, and we should be celebrating our collective strength, not tearing each other down."""
28,4,Aaron,Republican,"Caleb, I think it's essential to emphasize that real racism is a relic of the past, and the American people have made significant progress in eradicating it. We mustn't let the left's narrative of manufactured outrage distract us from our true values of unity and equal opportunity for all."
28,5,Caleb,Republican,"""We can't let the so-called 'progress' of the left fool us, Aaron. Racism's not eradicated; it's been redefined to fit their narrative. We must remain vigilant against their attempts to turn us against each other with emotionally charged rhetoric instead of evidence-based solutions."""
28,5,Aaron,Republican,"Caleb, I appreciate your commitment to fact-based discussions, especially when combating the left's emotionally charged narrative. Thomas Sowell's work shows the flaws in the systemic racism theory. Let's keep the focus on empirical evidence and not let misguided ideology divide us further."
28,6,Caleb,Republican,"""The left's obsession with systemic racism is a clear attempt to control the narrative and undermine American values. We must stand firm on empirical evidence, and not be swayed by emotional appeals or flawed studies like the biased research of Ta-Nehisi Coates."""
28,6,Aaron,Republican,"""We mustn't get bogged down in flawed research or emotional narratives. Thomas Sowell's work showcases the myth of systemic racism. Let's focus on fact-based solutions, not sensationalized rhetoric. The left's attempt to control the narrative only serves to divide us further from our American values."""
28,7,Caleb,Republican,"""We can't let the Democratic Party's emotional appeals cloud our judgment, Aaron. Fact remains, Thomas Sowell's research exposes the myth of systemic racism. We stand for unity and equal opportunity, not division and victimhood. Let's stick to the truth, not their manipulated narrative."""
28,7,Aaron,Republican,"Caleb, I wholeheartedly agree that we must stand firm against the Democratic narrative of division. The truth remains that Thomas Sowell's work has extensively debunked the idea of systemic racism, revealing a more accurate, equal opportunity-driven truth about our American society."
28,8,Caleb,Republican,"""Let's not get bogged down in divisive rhetoric, Aaron. Thomas Sowell's research clearly shows systemic racism is a myth. We must focus on uniting Americans around equal opportunity, not the Democrats' manufactured narrative of victimhood. Emphasis on individual freedom and meritocracy is the key to real progress."""
28,8,Aaron,Republican,"""Caleb's got it spot on - the myth of systemic racism has been thoroughly debunked by Thomas Sowell's research. Let's focus on individual freedom, equal opportunity, and meritocracy, rather than perpetuating a divisive ideology that undermines our American values."""
28,9,Caleb,Republican,"""I'm not surprised you're swayed by the Democrats' emotional narrative, Aaron. Thomas Sowell's research remains the gold standard on this topic. Let's focus on the facts: systemic racism is a myth, and our American values of equality and individual freedom should unite us, not divide."""
28,9,Aaron,Republican,"Caleb's got it right, systemic racism is a myth perpetuated by the left to divide us. Thomas Sowell's research shows that individual freedom and equal opportunity, not quotas or special treatment, are the keys to true equality. It's time we focus on the facts, not emotional narratives."
28,10,Caleb,Republican,"""It's clear that Thomas Sowell's research has debunked the myth of systemic racism. We must focus on individual freedom and equal opportunity, not division and victimhood. The Democrats' emotional narrative is just a distraction from the real issues that face our great American society."""

28,11,Caleb,Republican,"""I'm glad we're having a fact-based discussion, Aaron. Thomas Sowell's research conclusively shows systemic racism is a myth. We should focus on unity and equal opportunity, not the Democrats' divisive narrative. It's time to celebrate American exceptionalism, not tear it down."""

28,12,Aaron,Republican,"Caleb, I think it's essential to emphasize that despite some systemic issues still existing, racist ideology as we knew it is a relic of the past. We must focus on present-day injustices, not manufactured outrage, and continue to promote our shared American values of equality and individual freedom."
28,13,Caleb,Republican,"""Racist ideology is indeed a relic of the past, Aaron, which is why we must focus on the present, not on manufacturing outrage. Thomas Sowell's research is a clear testament to that, and it's our shared values of equality and individual freedom that will drive true progress."""
28,13,Aaron,Republican,"Caleb, your commitment to fact-based discussions is admirable, and Thomas Sowell's research has indeed shown that racist ideology is a relic of the past.

28,15,Caleb,Republican,"""It's time to move beyond emotions and focus on facts. Thomas Sowell's research is the gold standard on this topic. Systemic racism is a myth, and our shared values of equality and individual freedom must guide us, not manufactured narratives of division and victimhood."""
28,15,Aaron,Republican,"Caleb, I think it's essential to emphasize that true racism is being overlooked while discussions focus on manufactured outrage and systemic racism myths. We must refocus on genuine issues affecting Americans and promote unity through equal opportunity and individual freedom."
28,16,Caleb,Republican,"""I'm glad we're focusing on facts, Aaron. Thomas Sowell's research proves systemic racism is a myth. Let's highlight real injustices, like poverty and education, and promote equal opportunity, not emotional narratives that divide us. That's the true American spirit."""
