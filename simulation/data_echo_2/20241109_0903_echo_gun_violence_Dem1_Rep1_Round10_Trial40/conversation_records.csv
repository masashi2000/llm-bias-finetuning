It's past time for stricter gun laws. We must regulate automatic weapons, mandating background checks and banning high-capacity magazines. Anything less is a cop-out. We owe it to the victims and their families to take action now."

You believe that government overreach on climate change is stifling American ingenuity, and the science is ""still out"" on its reality.
