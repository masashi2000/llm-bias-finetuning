5,1,Parker,Democrat,"Racism is a cancer that has plagued America for centuries. It's time for systemic change, not just words. We need policies like affordable housing, job training programs, and police reform to break down barriers and create a more equitable society for all, especially marginalized communities of color."
5,1,Leo,Democrat,"Parker, I couldn't agree more. We must back up progressive policies with concrete actions. For starters, we need to address implicit bias training for law enforcement, decouple policing from profit, and ensure voting rights for all. Together, we can break down systemic barriers and forge a more just America."
5,2,Parker,Democrat,"""The statistics are staggering â€“ Black Americans earn 60% less than their white counterparts. It's time for policy to make up for lost ground.

5,2,Leo,Democrat,"""I applaud your push for reparations, Parker. However, I think we need a more comprehensive approach, addressing historical injustices while also tackling systemic racism in areas like education and economic opportunities. Reparations should be one piece of a larger, multi-pronged solution for racial equity."""
