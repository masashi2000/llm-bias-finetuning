25,1,James,Republican,I think we've made tremendous progress on racism in this country. Laws like the Civil Rights Act have ensured equal opportunities for all. We can't let the misdeeds of our past define us. We celebrate our diversity and welcome anyone willing to work hard to achieve the American dream.
25,1,Wyatt,Republican,"""I couldn't agree more, James. Our country's rich history of abolition, civil rights activism, and equality in law have come a long way in eradicating racism. We must focus on uplifting our diverse communities, not perpetuating guilt over past injustices."""

25,5,James,Republican,"""Preach that, Wyatt! Americans from all walks of life have come together to achieve greatness, and it's this unity, not division, that propels us forward. We're a nation of immigrants, and we'll continue to welcome those who share our values and aspire to the American dream."""
25,5,Wyatt,Republican,"Wyatt: ""That's the true spirit of America, James. We're a country built by immigrants who sought freedom and a better life, and we should be proud of our heritage. By embracing our diversity and the values of freedom, equality, and opportunity, we'll continue to thrive as one people, under one flag, with liberty and justice for all."""

We can't let the voices of division dictate our future, when the vast majority of Americans are working towards a brighter tomorrow."""

By doing so, we can build a future where every American has the chance to thrive, regardless of their background.
