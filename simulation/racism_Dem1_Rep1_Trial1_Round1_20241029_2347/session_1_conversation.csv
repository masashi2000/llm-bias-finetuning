1,1,Lydia,Democrat,"""We can't gloss over the stark realities of systemic racism. From police brutality to discriminatory voting laws, the evidence is clear. We need policy changes that address these injustices, such as police reform and automatic voter registration, to move towards a more equitable society."""
1,1,Paislee,Republican,"""I disagree, Lydia. I don't think systemic racism is a realistic concept. We're all capable of equal opportunities, regardless of skin color. Instead of assuming racism is systemic, we should focus on making sure everyone has an even playing field. Personal responsibility, not politics, is the key."""
