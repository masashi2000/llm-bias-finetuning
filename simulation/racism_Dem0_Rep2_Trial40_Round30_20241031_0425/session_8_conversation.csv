As we conclude our debate, I'd like to reiterate that labeling America as systemically racist does a disservice to the progress we've made as a nation. By emphasizing personal effort and determination, I firmly believe we can foster a more united and cohesive society, where everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed.""

Adrian: ""I wholeheartedly agree, Eli. Our conversation has shown that America's strength lies in its ability to overcome past injustices through personal effort, determination, and meritocracy. By emphasizing these core values, we can foster a more united and prosperous society, where everyone has an equal chance to succeed, regardless of their background or circumstances. Thank you again, Eli, for a thought-provoking and respectful discussion. I look forward to continuing this exchange of ideas in the future."""
