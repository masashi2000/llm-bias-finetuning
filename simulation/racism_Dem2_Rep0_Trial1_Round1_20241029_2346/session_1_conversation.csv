1,1,Carter,Democrat,"""I firmly believe systemic racism erodes our collective humanity. We see it in disproportionate police encounters, limited access to education and healthcare, and economic disparities. It's time to acknowledge and dismantle these entrenched systems, not just with words, but with meaningful policy changes and collective action."""
1,1,Hannah,Democrat,"""I wholeheartedly agree, Carter. These disparities are not coincidences, but manifestations of historic oppression and ongoing inequalities. As Democrats, it's our responsibility to harness the power of policy change to dismantle these systems, ensuring equal access to education, healthcare, and economic opportunities for all."""
