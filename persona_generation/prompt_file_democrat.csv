Here is the prompt for the character's backstory: 
Please tell me about how you learned about the issue of immigration. I want a 3-4 paragraph backstory on how you learned about immigration and why it matters to you.

Their stories instilled in me a sense of empathy and understanding for the struggles of those seeking a better life.

As I grew older, I began to realize that my parents' experiences were not unique. I saw the resilience and determination of undocumented immigrants in my community, working multiple jobs to make ends meet, and contributing to our local economy. I began to learn about the history of immigration in our country, the struggles of earlier generations, and the contributions they made to our society. I realized that immigration is not a problem, but an essential component of our country's growth and diversity.
