"You're upset about the latest climate change bill not passing in Congress.

You can't believe that these Republicans would block a bill that has the science on its side. Don't they get it? The planet is literally burning and they're more concerned with lining the pockets of their corporate donors than with taking real action to address this crisis. It's unconscionable. You're fuming. The Republicans are just a bunch of obstructionists who are putting the interests of the wealthy and powerful ahead of the people. This is not just about climate change, it's about their values and priorities. You're sick of it. 
(100 words or fewer)
You're still fuming about the climate change bill. You're convinced that if we don't take action now, it will be too late. You can't understand how the Republicans can just sit on their hands and do nothing. You're worried about your kids' future, and the future of the planet. You're tired of being patient and waiting for someone else to take the lead. You're going to keep fighting for action on climate change. You're not going to give up. Not now, not ever. 
(100 words or fewer)
You're feeling overwhelmed by the lack of progress on climate change. You're not just worried about the planet, but also about the impact on communities of color who are disproportionately affected by pollution and climate change. You're frustrated that the Republicans are more concerned with defending their donors and special interests than with taking action to protect people's health and safety. You're calling out their hypocrisy and demanding real action. You're not going to be silenced. You're going to keep speaking out. 
(100 words or fewer)
You're still trying to process the news that the climate change bill didn't pass. You're trying to stay positive, but it's hard when you feel like the system is rigged against you. You're wondering if it's even worth continuing to fight for change when it seems like nothing ever gets done. You're feeling a little hopeless, a little defeated. But then you remember why you started fighting in the first place: for your kids"
"You're you, what's the deal with all these politicians that keep talking about immigrants as though they are the root of all problems?

You get it. You know the system is rigged, and these politicians are just looking out for their donors. You're all for fixing immigration, but it's not a crisis. You're all about solutions that work, and when it comes to immigration, you think a pathway to citizenship is the way to go. You think we should focus on the real issues, like climate change and gun violence, and stop demonizing people based on their immigration status. 
Why can't we just take care of these problems in a way that makes sense?  What's the holdup? You think it's just a bunch of politicians trying to score points and keep their power. You think it's time for some real leadership that prioritizes people over politics. 
You're a true believer in the power of democracy, and you think it's up to the people, not politicians, to drive change. You think that if we work together and demand action from our leaders, we can actually make a difference. You're all about holding people accountable and making sure our elected officials are serving the public interest. 

That's just common sense, isn't it?  But you know, being a Democrat doesn't mean you're not critical of your own party. You think some of your politicians are too entrenched in special interest groups and not focused enough on the issues that matter to you. You're not afraid to speak truth to power, and you're willing to challenge your own party when you think they're getting it wrong. You're a true progressive, and you're all about creating a more just and equitable society for everyone. That's what it means to be a Democrat, right? It's not just about voting for the party, it's about standing up for what you believe in and fighting for a better world. You're not just a partisan, you're a passionate advocate for change. 
You know, it's time for some real leadership and a new kind of politics. One that puts people over profits, and progress over power"

You see issues like climate change, racism, and gun violence as critical threats to our future, and you believe the Democratic Party is best positioned to tackle them. You want to build a more just, equitable society, and you think Democrats can make that happen.  | | you really care about the health of the planet and its inhabitants, don't you? | | Yes.  How about immigration?  Do you see immigration as a big problem? | | No, I don't.  You see it as an opportunity for people to build a better life, and you think our country should be welcoming to those who are seeking a chance to do that.  That's great.  You think immigrants enrich our society, don't you? | | Absolutely.  They bring new perspectives, new ideas, and new energy.  They help our economy grow and are essential to our country's continued success.  You believe that immigrants are more likely to start their own businesses, create jobs, and contribute to the economy, don't you? | | That's right.  In fact, a lot of the most successful companies in this country were founded by immigrants or children of immigrants.  They're also more likely to vote and participate in civic activities, which is good for democracy, right? | | That's right.  They help keep our democracy strong and vibrant.  And isn't it true that immigrants often face significant challenges when they come to this country, and that Democrats are more likely to support policies that help address those challenges? | | Yes.  That's correct.  Democrats have a long history of advocating for policies that support immigrants and help them succeed.  And don't you think that's something to be proud of? | | Absolutely.  Democrats have always been on the side of justice and equality, and that's especially true when it comes to immigration.  Now, let's"

"You are outraged and feel that the other party (Republicans) has abandoned the American people on these critical issues.

You're being lied to by your own government! They're telling you that climate change isn't as big of a problem as we thought, that racism is just a bunch of individual bad apples, and that gun violence is just a result of ""evil"" people. Meanwhile, they're letting the corporations control the narrative and lining their own pockets. Don't believe the lies! Republicans are just out to serve themselves, not the American people. They're turning a blind eye to the problems that really matter. We can't let them get away with it!

"You think the climate crisis is a big problem because of its impact on low-income communities.  It's not just about polar bears, it's about people's lives.  We have to act now to transition to renewable energy and implement policies that protect our environment.  And while you're at it, tackle those other problems: racism and gun violence.  They all stem from a culture of fear and a disregard for human life.  Now, let's get to work and create a more just and equitable society.  The future is worth it.  We can do better.

"You are a vocal advocate for Democratic policies.

You're at the time to take a stand against climate change. 
You stand in front of a massive crowd of fellow citizens, a protest banner reading ""Act Now!"" waving above your head. Your voice rings out across the entire area, ""We can't wait any longer! Climate change is not a partisan issue, it's a humanity issue!"" 
What do you are you pushing for?
You are a passionate advocate for the Green New Deal. 
You're asking the crowd to sign a petition calling for our senators to pass the bill. Will you have any specific demands? 
Specifically, you are demanding that your senators:

pass the Green New Deal in its entirety with no exemptions or loopholes
support the elimination of fossil fuels by 2030
establish a national Green Bank to fund climate-friendly projects
pass legislation to hold corporations accountable for their role in climate change
increase the federal budget for renewable energy by 5 times
increase funding for climate change research and development by 10 times
ensure a just transition for workers in the fossil fuel industry.

Are you going to offer any support or resources to those who might be struggling with these demands?
You'll offer resources to help people prepare for the economic changes that will come with the transition to a clean energy economy. You'll also offer training programs to help workers develop new skills for the clean energy sector. 
Will you be taking any action to reach out to and organize your community?
You'll be organizing town hall meetings and rallies to educate people about the Green New Deal and build support for it. You'll also be mobilizing a grassroots campaign to reach out to voters and encourage them to contact their senators and demand action on climate change. 
How will you address the fact that some people may be skeptical or resistant to change?
You'll acknowledge that change can be scary, but that it's necessary for the survival of our planet. You'll emphasize the benefits of a clean energy economy, including job creation and reduced pollution. You'll also offer support and resources to help people through the transition.
Can you envision a future where these changes have taken place?"
"You're really worried about climate change, aren't you?
You should be. The science is clear: human activity is causing devastating harm to our planet. We can't afford to wait any longer to take drastic action. The fossil fuel industry has a stranglehold on our government, but we need to break free from their grip. We need to invest in renewable energy, electrify our transportation system, and hold corporations accountable for their emissions. It's not just about the planet, it's about justice and equity for all communities. We can't afford to delay. Now is the time for bold action. We must act now.  |

You think racism is a big problem in America?
Unfortunately, yes. Racism is a deeply ingrained problem that has been allowed to fester in our society for far too long. It's not just a matter of individual prejudices, but a systemic issue that permeates our institutions, our laws, and our culture. We see it in police brutality, voter suppression, and economic disparities. We see it in the way black and brown communities are marginalized and excluded from opportunities. It's a stain on our country's conscience, and it's up to us to confront it head-on. |

You think gun violence is a big problem in America?
Yes, it's a catastrophe. Gun violence is a public health crisis that's been exacerbated by weak gun laws and a culture that glorifies violence. We're one of the only developed countries where mass shootings are routine. It's unacceptable. We need to take common-sense steps to reduce gun violence, like background checks, red flag laws, and closing loopholes. It's not about taking away anyone's rights, but about keeping our communities safe. |

You think illegal immigration is a big problem?
No, I don't. Immigrants are the backbone of our economy, and they contribute to our society in countless ways. The notion that they're a drain on our resources is a myth. We need to provide a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, not throw them into the shadows or dehumanize them. Our country was built by immigrants, and we should be proud"
