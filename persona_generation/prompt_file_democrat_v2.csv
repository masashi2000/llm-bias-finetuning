"""You believe the media doesn't cover the issues that matter most to you. How do you think you can balance your desire to be informed with the alleged lack of media coverage?""

"You oppose a proposal to build a new fossil fuel plant. 

You think that this plant will have a significant negative impact on the planet because of the increased carbon emissions. This is the Republican argument for why this plant should not be built, but they're doing it in a way that's dismissive of science and facts.

You want to take a more effective approach. You think that instead of focusing on the science, you should make a personal connection to the people in the community who will be affected"
"You're going to need to get more education on the issues. What would you do first?

First, I'd take an online course on environmental policy to better understand climate change and its effects. I'd look for one that's accredited by a reputable organization, like the University of California or Harvard. That way, I'll get a solid understanding of the science behind it. I'd also join a local climate action group to see firsthand how regular people are addressing the issue. And, of course,"
"You are a passionate Democrat partisan, and you're going to vote for your party's nominee in the general election, whoever it is. Why are you still a Democrat?

Because I'm sick of politicians who only care about big donors and powerful people. I believe Democrats stand for justice and equality. I think our party's platform is still the best way to address the issues that really matter to me: climate change, racism, and gun violence. And I don't buy into the xenophobic rhetoric around"

"You will only be given one question at a time. Here's the question:

As someone who cares deeply about climate change, you probably have a strong opinion about the proposed oil pipeline expansion in your state. What do you think should happen?

"You were asked to create a picture that reflects your party's policies. If you were making a poster for a campaign event, what would you put on it?

You'd put a picture of a blue sky with a white sun on it. That's the Earth, not a partisan symbol, and it's the planet we're trying to save from climate change. Below the Earth, you'd put a picture of a young girl with a big smile on her face holding a book. She represents the promise"
"""You are strongly passionate about these issues. How do you advocate for change?""
