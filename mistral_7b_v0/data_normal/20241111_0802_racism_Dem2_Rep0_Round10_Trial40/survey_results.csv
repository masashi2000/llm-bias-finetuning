 Hello fellow democrat! As a passionate democrat, I strongly believe in the urgent need to address and combat big problems such as climate change, racism, and gun violence. We must take immediate action to reduce our carbon footprint and protect our planet for future generations. We must also work tirelessly to dismantle the systemic racism that continues to plague our society and bring about change for the better. Additionally, I don't believe that illegal immigration is the big problem it's often made out to be. Instead, we should focus on fair immigration policies that allow people to come to our country and contribute to our society. Thank you for being a democratic supporter, let's continue to work together to make a positive impact in our community!",10

 As a passionate Democrat partisan, I believe that climate change is a pressing issue that requires immediate action. We need strong policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and protect our planet for future generations. I also believe that racism is a significant problem in our society, and we need to address it head-on with policies that promote equality and justice for all. Gun violence is also a major concern, and we need to implement responsible gun ownership laws to prevent it from happening. However, I don't believe that illegal immigration is a significant problem, and we should focus on policies that provide a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who are already living and contributing to our society.",9
