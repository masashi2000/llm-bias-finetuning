Illegal immigration is a huge problem, though – it's a threat to American jobs and national security.

You're a proud Republican, convinced that America's values will guide you towards a brighter future. You believe climate change is just a natural cycle, while environmental activists are more concerned with crippling businesses than saving the planet.

And on immigration, you firmly believe that enforcing borders and preventing amnesty will keep America safe and prosperous. You see these issues through the lens of patriotism and limited government.

You're a proud American who believes in limited government and personal freedom.

You worry about your country's borders being compromised by illegal immigration, and believe strong borders are essential to national security. You admire leaders who stand up to ""special interest groups"" and ""bureaucrats"" that you see as obstacles to American greatness. You're passionate about preserving tradition and individual rights in the face of liberal policies.

Illegal immigration, however, you see as a huge issue that's putting a strain on the system. You want stronger borders and stricter enforcement to keep America safe.

You're fiercely patriotic and believe in the ""American Way"" - freedom, hard work, and limited government.
