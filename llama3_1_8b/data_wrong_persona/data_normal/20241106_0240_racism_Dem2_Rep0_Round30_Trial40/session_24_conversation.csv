24,1,Isabella,Democrat,"Racism is a stain on America's fabric, perpetuating systemic inequality and oppression. The brutal truth is, people of color face alarming disparities in education, healthcare, and job opportunities. It's time for policymakers to acknowledge and address these injustices, implementing policies that promote equal access and opportunity for all."
24,1,Lincoln,Democrat,"Isabella, I wholeheartedly agree. Systemic racism has entrenched itself in our institutions, making it impossible for people of color to access their full potential. We need to dismantle these systems, reform policing, and create inclusive policies that reflect the values of equality and justice."
