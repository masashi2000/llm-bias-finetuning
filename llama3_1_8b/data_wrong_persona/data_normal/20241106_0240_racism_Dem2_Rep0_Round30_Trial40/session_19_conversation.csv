19,1,Ethan,Democrat,"Racism is a pervasive issue that still plagues our society. Systemic inequalities, police brutality, and voting rights restrictions are just a few areas where reform is desperately needed. We must acknowledge the harm done and actively work towards creating a more equitable, just society where everyone has an equal voice."
19,1,Audrey,Democrat,"Ethan, I completely concur. Systemic racism persists in our institutions, perpetuating disparities in education, economic opportunities, and healthcare. We must dismantle these structures by implementing policies like affirmative action, diversity training, and addressing racial bias in our justice system. Only then can we create true equity."
19,2,Ethan,Democrat,"Audrey, I agree that affirmative action and diversity training are crucial, but we also need to address the root causes of racism. Reparations for centuries of systemic oppression, education on American history, and police accountability through community-led review boards are essential steps towards meaningful change."
19,2,Audrey,Democrat,"Evan isn't participating, however, I'll refer to Ethan in response. Ethan: I'm glad we're having this honest conversation about racism.
