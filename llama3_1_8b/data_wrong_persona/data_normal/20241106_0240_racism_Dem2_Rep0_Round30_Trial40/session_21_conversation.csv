21,1,Samuel,Democrat,"Racism is a cancer that must be cut out. Systemic racism embedded in our institutions is a blatant injustice. We must dismantle these systems and create policies that address disparities in education, healthcare, and economic opportunities. It's time for reparative justice and a path towards true equality."
21,1,Skylar,Democrat,"Samuel, I couldn't agree more. Reparative justice and dismantling systems of oppression are vital. But words alone aren't enough – we need concrete policies and action from our leaders. I propose targeted job training programs, culturally competent education reform, and increased funding for community-based organizations serving marginalized communities."
21,2,Samuel,Democrat,"""Skylar, I wholeheartedly agree. Targeted job training programs and culturally competent education reform can help break cycles of poverty and oppression. However, we also need accountability mechanisms to ensure institutions and leaders don't perpetuate the same systems of oppression."""
21,2,Skylar,Democrat,"""I completely agree, Samuel. Accountability mechanisms are crucial. Regular audits and investigations should be implemented to track institutions' progress and hold them responsible for systemic changes. Whistleblower protection and incentives for reporting discriminatory practices should also be implemented to encourage honesty and transparency."""

21,3,Skylar,Democrat,"""Absolutely, Samuel. Voter suppression measures are a veil for systemic racism. We must work to restore the Voting Rights Act, expand voting access, and implement policies like automatic voter registration, early voting, and mail-in voting to ensure every voice is heard and represented."""
21,4,Samuel,Democrat,"""We must acknowledge the historical context of racism and its ongoing impact on marginalized communities.
