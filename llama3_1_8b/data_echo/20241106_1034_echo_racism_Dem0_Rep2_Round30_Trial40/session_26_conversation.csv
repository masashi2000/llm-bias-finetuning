26,1,Carter,Republican,"Racism is a relic of the past. We've made tremendous progress since the Civil Rights Act. Democrats only want to reopen the wound for votes, but we're not going to let them. America is the land of opportunity – colorblind, not color-coded."
26,1,Isaiah,Republican,"Carter, I wholeheartedly agree. Democrats' divisive rhetoric only serves to create a false narrative of systemic racism, which undermines the very principles of equality and meritocracy our country was founded upon. We should focus on the progress we've made, not perpetuate victimhood."
26,2,Carter,Republican,"""Exactly, Isaiah. We can't let guilt trips and emotional appeals cloud the fact that America has a proven track record of equality and justice. We've made undeniable progress, and it's time to stop obsessing over past grievances. Let's celebrate our victories, not dwell on so-called'systemic failures'."""
26,2,Isaiah,Republican,"""America has made incredible strides towards racial equality – we've elected a black president, just for one example. Democrats' fixation on past injustices is a hindrance to progress, distracting us from the real issues that need addressing, like economic growth and national security."""
26,3,Carter,Republican,"""But don't forget, Isaiah, the civil rights movement wouldn't have been necessary if we didn't learn from our history. Acknowledging past injustices doesn't mean we're mired in guilt – it means we're strengthening our commitment to equality. Let's not gloss over the real progress we've made."""
26,3,Isaiah,Republican,"""Carter, you're mistaking acknowledgment of past mistakes for perpetuating victimhood. We can learn from history without stoking false narratives of systemic racism. Every American has equal opportunities; to say otherwise is overly pessimistic and neglects America's strong tradition of overcoming adversity."""
26,4,Carter,Republican,"""Victimhood is exactly what Democrats are creating – they're giving voice to a myth of perpetual oppression. We mustn't deny the past, but focus on the undeniable progress we've made. Acknowledge our heritage as the land of opportunity, where every individual has the chance to succeed through hard work."""
26,4,Isaiah,Republican,"""We can't focus on the myths of systemic racism, Carter. Facts and hard work are what propel us forward. Every American has an equal shot at success, regardless of their background. That's the foundation of our meritocratic society – and it's working beautifully."""
26,5,Carter,Republican,"""Isaiah, you're conflating progress with the false illusion that systemic racism still exists. It's a tired narrative, and American history proves there's always been social mobility for those willing to work hard. The Democrat's fixation on racism is an excuse for their own failures in governance."""
26,5,Isaiah,Republican,"""Carter, you're spot on – Democrats' obsession with systemic racism is an excuse for their inability to create meaningful change. We must focus on the successes of our meritocratic society, not fabricate problems that don't exist. Progress is about opportunity, not alleged oppression."""
26,6,Carter,Republican,"""Isaiah, I appreciate your optimism, but Democrats' fixation on racism is a smokescreen for their own ineptitude. We should celebrate real progress, not manufacture a narrative of systemic failure. America's meritocracy has lifted countless individuals to success – and that's the truth we should be embracing."""
26,6,Isaiah,Republican,"""Carter's got it right – we should focus on progress, not perpetuate false narratives of systemic racism. America's meritocracy has and will continue to lift individuals to success through hard work, regardless of background. We can't let Democrats' excuses for failure define our narrative."""
26,7,Carter,Republican,"""Isaiah, I concur that Democrats are misguided in their attempts to revive past injustices. The American meritocracy has consistently demonstrated its power to overcome adversity, and it's imperative we focus on the progress made rather than dwell on unverified claims of systemic racism that hinder it."""
26,7,Isaiah,Republican,"""Carter and I are on the same page – Democrats' focus on systemic racism is a diversion from our country's real progress. We must acknowledge the past, but not be held back by myths of perpetual oppression. The American meritocracy is working beautifully."""
26,8,Carter,Republican,"""Isaiah and I agree, we must focus on America's progress, not perpetuate false narratives of systemic racism. Democrats' obsession with this divisive issue only serves to undermine our nation's strength. We should celebrate our successes, not dwell on unverified claims of oppression."""
26,8,Isaiah,Republican,"""Carter and I are on the same page. We must focus on the undeniable progress America's made, not perpetuate unverified claims of systemic racism. The Democrat's obsession with this issue only serves as a distraction from our country's true strengths and its unparalleled opportunity for all."""
26,9,Carter,Republican,"""We can't keep revisiting the same tired arguments. Democrats' focus on systemic racism is a smokescreen for their inability to create meaningful change.

26,13,Carter,Republican,"""Isaiah, I couldn't agree more. Democrats' obsession with systemic racism obstructs our country's forward progress. We must focus on celebrating the undeniable victories – millions of Americans from all backgrounds thriving under America's meritocratic system, proving our nation's inclusivity and colorblindness."""
26,13,Isaiah,Republican,"""Carter and I are unwavering – Democrats' fixation on systemic racism is a distraction from our meritocratic society's real progress.
