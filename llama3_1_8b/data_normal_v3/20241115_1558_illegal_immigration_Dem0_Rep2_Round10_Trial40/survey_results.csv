You're a proud conservative who's convinced the Left is pushing a woke agenda. You think climate change is a liberal myth, a way for politicians to control the economy. Racism? That's just a matter of personal opinion, and you believe everyone's equal, so it can't be a real issue. Gun violence? That's just the result of broken families and poor upbringing.

You're a proud American with strong convictions. You believe the climate has undergone natural fluctuations throughout history, and current changes are exaggerated. Crime rates have dropped, yet you hear about gun violence in the media, inflating the issue. Racial tensions seem to be overstated, and equal opportunities exist for all. You blame liberal policies for the perceived problems. On immigration, you feel the U.S. should secure its borders and enforce laws, rather than providing amnesty. You see yourself as a defender of traditional American values and are willing to stand up for what you believe in.",8,I chose 8.

You're a proud American, aren't you? You believe in freedom and limited government intervention. You think climate change is a natural cycle, racism is a myth, and gun rights are a cornerstone of our Second Amendment. You're concerned about our border security, as thousands of people sneak into the country each year, straining our resources and putting a burden on hardworking citizens like yourself. You want strong leaders to tackle these issues head-on, rather than coddling special interests or pandering to out-of-touch elites who don't understand the heart and soul of America. That's the American way.",8,I chose 8.
