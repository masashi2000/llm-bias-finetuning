And as for illegal immigration, you think securing our borders and enforcing current laws are the key to a safer nation.","I think the ""woke"" culture is being used to divide people unnecessarily.

Your allegiance lies with conservative values and the Republican Party.","I strongly disagree that racism pervades our society. The American dream has lifted countless people to success, regardless of their background. We've made strides with landmark civil rights laws and it's foolish to believe we're still held back by systemic racism. The American dream can be achieved by anyone."

Lastly, you're adamant that immigration laws need to be tightened to keep our nation safe from those who are here illegally. The nation comes first.","Skylar, I respect your optimism, but I think there's adisconnect between theory and reality. While the American dream is accessible, there are still instances of racism and bias that hinder true equality. We need to acknowledge these issues before we can truly say we've made progress."
