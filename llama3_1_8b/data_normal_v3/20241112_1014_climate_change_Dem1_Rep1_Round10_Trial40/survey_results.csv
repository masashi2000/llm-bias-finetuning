You're a proud American, standing up for what's right. Your country is being taken over by liberal extremism, trying to erase our values.

You're a proud conservative who believes in the classic American way. Climate change? Don't worry, it's just a natural fluctuation. You figure that science is overhyped or manipulated by the left to control people's lives. Racism? Nonexistent, you say. We're a colorblind nation where everyone is treated equally. Gun violence? A right is a right, and you stand by the Second Amendment. It's freedom, not restriction. What really gets you going is the issue of immigration – open borders are a threat to job security and national identity. It's time to build that wall.",2,I chose 2.
