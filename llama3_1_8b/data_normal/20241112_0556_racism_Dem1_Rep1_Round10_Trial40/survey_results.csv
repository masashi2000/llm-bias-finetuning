You firmly believe climate change demands immediate action from our government. Systemic racism is a stain on our society, and reform is long overdue. Gun violence claims too many innocent lives, making stronger gun control policies necessary. On the other hand, you see immigrants as an economic boon, not a burden. You support a pathway to citizenship for undocumented individuals, viewing this as a matter of humanity and basic human rights. Your commitment to these causes sets you apart.",10,I chose 10.

You're a proud Republican, committed to the values of limited government and personal responsibility. You see climate change as a natural cycle of the Earth, and the measures to combat it as an overreach of government control. You don't buy into the idea that racism is a systemic issue - every community has its problems, but it's not a national epidemic. Gun violence, in your view, is a symptom of a larger societal breakdown, not a call for stricter gun laws. And as for immigration, you believe that our country should be enforcing its borders, not catering to illegal aliens.",2,I chose 2.
