12,1,Aurora,Republican,"""I highly disagree that systemic racism exists in the US. That notion only serves to divide us. We have a history of progress, and affirmative action programs unfairly favor certain groups, creating more resentment. We need to focus on equal opportunities, not special treatment."""
12,1,Stella,Republican,"""I understand your concerns about affirmative action, Aurora. However, to deny systemic racism's existence is naive. Our history of slavery, segregation, and ongoing discriminatory practices shows that policies, not just individuals, have contributed to racial disparities. We need to acknowledge this to move forward."""
12,2,Aurora,Republican,"""I understand Stella's desire to recognize the past, but acknowledging systemic racism won't eliminate it. Rather than dwelling on blame, we should focus on equality through equal opportunities, not quotas or special treatment. This is where true progress lies."""
12,2,Stella,Republican,"""Aurora, while I agree on focusing on equality, you can't dismiss systemic racism's impact. Acknowledging the problem helps us address the root causes. Dismantling discriminatory policies and practices will only create a fairer environment. This isn't about blame, but about creating real progress together."""
12,3,Aurora,Republican,"""I understand Stella's passion, but acknowledging systemic racism won't magically fix anything. Instead, let's focus on policy solutions that promote individual opportunity, like job training, mentorship, and economic empowerment. This approach encourages true meritocracy and lifts people up, rather than lowering the expectations for them."""
12,3,Stella,Republican,"""Aurora, while policies promoting individual opportunity are crucial, they're insufficient on their own. History shows that discriminatory policies and practices have shaped systemic racism. Addressing the root causes will help ensure that our policy solutions truly create equal opportunities, not just mask the symptoms."""
12,4,Aurora,Republican,"""Acknowledging systemic racism won't resolve the issue; it'll only perpetuate a culture of victimhood. Let's focus on policy solutions that empower individuals, not create handouts based on skin color. We should celebrate the progress America has made, not dwell on past grievances."""
12,4,Stella,Republican,"""Aurora, victimhood mentality is a straw man. Acknowledging systemic racism doesn't say you're a victim; it says we have to work to dismantle the entrenched discriminatory systems that keep many from truly having equal footing. That's not handouts, it's fairness."""
12,5,Aurora,Republican,"""Stella, I disagree. Victimhood mentality does persist and often prevents people from taking responsibility for their lives. We need to focus on individual empowerment, not collective grievance. Celebrating progress, not dwelling on past faults, will drive true equality forward in this great country of ours."""
12,5,Stella,Republican,"""Aurora, individual empowerment is indeed crucial, but we can't ignore the reality of systemic racism's hold. It's time to both empower individuals and dismantle the discriminatory systems that historically held many back. This dual approach will drive true, long-lasting equality, not just a mask for injustice."""
12,6,Aurora,Republican,"""Stella, I think you're confusing America's history with our current reality. We've made tremendous progress; why dwell on past grievances? Let's focus on policies that empower individuals through equal opportunities, not handouts based on skin color. That's the true path to lasting equality."""
12,6,Stella,Republican,"""Aurora, I'm not dwelling on past grievances, but rather acknowledging the foundation of systemic racism that still affects our society today. Without confronting our history, we risk repeating the same mistakes and delaying true equality."""
12,7,Aurora,Republican,"""Stella, I still think we're focusing on the past instead of the present. We should celebrate America's progress, not get bogged down in historical grievances. Let's keep the discussion centered on policies that empower individuals through equal opportunities, not dwell on past injustices."""
12,7,Stella,Republican,"""Aurora, acknowledging our past is not dwelling in it. We can't create a meritocracy if discriminatory systems remain in place. Acknowledging systemic racism gives us a foundation to build true equality, not a list of handouts. Progress requires confronting the root causes of our country's inequalities."""
12,8,Aurora,Republican,"""I respect Stella's perspective, but acknowledging past injustices won't solve them. History will repeat itself if we only talk about it. Let's focus on implementing policies that genuinely offer equal opportunities to all, regardless of background, and celebrate America's progress, not dwell on its past."""
12,8,Stella,Republican,"""Aurora, you can't celebrate progress without acknowledging the progress achieved is often built upon, not despite, discriminatory systems. To truly empower individuals, we must address the systemic barriers that undermine our equality, not just hope history will magically fix itself."""
12,9,Aurora,Republican,"""I still believe acknowledging systemic racism will only perpetuate a culture of victimhood and divisiveness. Stella's approach implies that America is irreparably broken, whereas I see a nation making great strides towards equality through individual opportunities and economic empowerment."""
12,9,Stella,Republican,"""Aurora, I think you're oversimplifying the issue. Acknowledging systemic racism doesn't mean we're irreparably broken; it means we can address the entrenched barriers. Without acknowledging the past, we're doomed to repeat it. We need to confront the root causes of inequality, not just celebrate progress."""
12,10,Aurora,Republican,"""I still don't believe acknowledging systemic racism will lead to true progress. Instead, let's focus on real solutions: equal opportunities, merit-based policies, and uplifting individuals. Stella's approach is too focused on the past, preventing us from building a brighter future for all Americans."""
12,10,Stella,Republican,"""Aurora, we can't build a brighter future for all Americans without acknowledging the past. Systemic racism is a complex issue that requires a multi-faceted approach â€“ economic empowerment, policy reform, and individual opportunities. Ignoring its existence won't erase its impact; confronting it will bring lasting equality."""
12,11,Aurora,Republican,"""I still believe Stella's focus on acknowledging past injustices is misplaced. We should prioritize policies that empower individuals through equal opportunities and economic growth, allowing every American to succeed, regardless of their background, without dwelling on what's been done to us."""
12,11,Stella,Republican,"""Aurora, ignoring systemic racism's complex history won't erase its effects. Economic empowerment, policy reform, and individual opportunities are crucial, but they can't replace addressing the entrenched barriers that hold many back. We can't build a brighter future for all Americans by turning a blind eye to our past."""
12,12,Aurora,Republican,"""Stella, I still believe history's lessons should inspire hope, not define us. Focusing on past grievances prevents us from addressing systemic issues through policy solutions that empower individuals, creating equal opportunities for all, regardless of background."""
12,12,Stella,Republican,"""Aurora, history's lessons should indeed inspire hope, but they also teach us where we went wrong. Ignoring our past discriminatory policies and practices ensures we'll repeat them. It's time to confront our history, address the root causes, and build a truly equal society for all Americans."""
12,13,Aurora,Republican,"""I still disagree, Stella, that dwelling on past injustices will drive progress. Focusing on individual empowerment through equal opportunities and merit-based policies will create a brighter future for all Americans, without letting the past dictate our actions."""
12,13,Stella,Republican,"""Aurora, I'll reiterate: history is not just lessons, but the foundation of our present. Ignoring systemic racism's complex history won't erase its effects. We must confront the past to build a truly equal society, not just celebrate progress, but drive it with lasting change."""
12,14,Aurora,Republican,"""Stella, we're talking past each other. Acknowledging systemic racism won't magically solve inequality; it'll only create more divisions. Policies like job training, mentorship, and economic empowerment truly empower individuals, regardless of their background, leading to a brighter future for all Americans."""
12,14,Stella,Republican,"""Aurora, just because acknowledging systemic racism might stir controversy doesn't mean we shouldn't address it. Blindly focusing on individual empowerment can mask institutional barriers that perpetuate inequality. Confronting our past is necessary to build a truly equal society, not just a facade of progress."""
12,15,Aurora,Republican,"""I still maintain, Stella, that focusing on past grievances clouds our vision for individual empowerment and true equality. We should celebrate America's strides and implement policy solutions like job training, mentorship, and economic growth to help every American succeed, not dwell on what divided us in the past."""
12,15,Stella,Republican,"""Aurora, I understand we disagree, but acknowledging systemic racism doesn't cloud our vision; it sharpens it. By confronting the past, we can build a society where everyone has an equal chance to succeed, regardless of their background or the color of their skin."""
12,16,Aurora,Republican,"Stella, I understand we disagree, but your focus on past grievances overshadows America's progress. We should strive for individual empowerment through equal opportunities and merit-based policies, creating a brighter future for all Americans, and celebrate our nation's strides towards equality, not dwell on past injustices."
12,16,Stella,Republican,"""Aurora, I believe your focus on individual empowerment overlooks the systemic barriers that hinder equal opportunities. Addressing our nation's complex history and discriminatory policies is crucial to building a truly equal society, not just a facade of progress."""
12,17,Aurora,Republican,"Stella, I still believe that America's past progress and ongoing efforts towards equality prove our system works. Acknowledging and dwelling on systemic racism perpetuates a culture of victimhood and hinders real change. Let's focus on policies that empower individuals and celebrate our nation's strides, not dwell on flaws."
12,17,Stella,Republican,"Aurora, I still believe that acknowledging systemic racism is crucial to addressing the entrenched barriers that hinder equal opportunities. Ignoring our past only ensures we'll repeat it. We must confront our history to build a truly equal society, not just celebrate progress in name only."
12,18,Aurora,Republican,"""Stella, I disagree that acknowledging systemic racism will drive progress. Instead, let's focus on implementing policies that promote individual opportunity, like education and job training, which empower everyone, regardless of background, and create a brighter future for all Americans."""
12,18,Stella,Republican,"Aurora, while education and job training are crucial, they can't replace addressing the systemic barriers that historically held many back. Ignoring our past only delays true equality. It's time to confront the root causes and build a society where equal opportunities aren't just buzzwords, but a reality."
12,19,Aurora,Republican,"""I still believe Stella's approach overlooks the progress America has made and perpetuates a culture of victimhood. By focusing on individual empowerment and equal opportunities, we can create a brighter future for all Americans, regardless of their background, without dwelling on past injustices."""
12,19,Stella,Republican,"Aurora, while I respect your optimism, ignoring systemic racism will only delay true equality. Confronting our past is necessary to dismantle entrenched barriers and build a society where everyone has an equal chance to succeed, not just a facade of progress."
12,20,Aurora,Republican,"""Acknowledging systemic racism creates a culture of victimhood. We should focus on policy solutions that empower individuals through equal opportunities, celebrating America's progress, not dwelling on past grievances. Let's drive true equality with economic empowerment, not just buzzwords."""
12,20,Stella,Republican,"""Aurora, acknowledging systemic racism doesn't say individuals are victims â€“ it says we have to dismantle discriminatory systems that hinder true equality. Without confronting our past, we risk repeating the same mistakes. It's time to address the root causes and build a fairer society for all."""
12,21,Aurora,Republican,"""A Stella, I still maintain that focusing on past grievances overshadows America's progress. By emphasizing policy solutions and individual empowerment through equal opportunities, we can unlock a brighter future for all Americans, regardless of their background, without dwelling on past injustices."""
12,21,Stella,Republican,"""Aurora, focusing solely on individual empowerment overlooks the decades of systemic policies that perpetuated racial inequality. We must acknowledge and dismantle these barriers to create true equality, not just a facade of progress. Addressing the past is crucial to building a fairer society for all."""
12,22,Aurora,Republican,"""I still think Stella's focus on the past is misplaced. Our history is complex, but America's progress shows our system can work. Let's prioritize individual empowerment through equal opportunities, celebrating our strides towards equality, not dwelling on past flaws."""
12,22,Stella,Republican,"""Aurora, celebrating our strides is just that â€“ celebration. But our system can only truly work when we acknowledge and dismantle the entrenched discriminatory barriers that hinder equal opportunities for all. That's the foundation for real progress, not just acknowledging progress."""
12,23,Aurora,Republican,"""Stella, your focus on the past creates false divisions. Individual empowerment through equal opportunities, economic growth, and merit-based policies will drive true equality. We've made tremendous progress; why dwell on past injustices? Let's celebrate America's strides and build a brighter future for all, without past burdens."""
12,23,Stella,Republican,"""Aurora, it's not about dwelling on past injustices; it's about acknowledging the entrenched barriers that still exist. By confronting our history, we can dismantle these systems and build a fairer society, where individual empowerment truly leads to equal opportunities for all Americans."""
12,24,Aurora,Republican,"""Stella, we've made significant progress, and I believe acknowledging systemic racism overshadows America's strides. Let's focus on individual empowerment through economic growth, education, and merit-based policies. These tangible solutions will drive true equality, not dwelling on past grievances that can't be changed."""
12,24,Stella,Republican,"""Aurora, acknowledging systemic racism doesn't diminish America's progress; it highlights the work still to be done. True equality requires confronting our complex past and dismantling entrenched barriers, not just celebrating present strides. That's how we build a fairer, more equal society for all Americans."""
12,25,Aurora,Republican,"""Stella, I still believe focusing on systemic racism creates more divisions than progress. Instead, let's focus on policies that empower individuals through equal opportunities and economic growth, creating a brighter future for all Americans, regardless of background, without dwelling on past injustices."""
12,25,Stella,Republican,"""Aurora, our debate highlights the complexity of this issue. While individual empowerment is crucial, we can't ignore systemic racism's hold.

12,26,Aurora,Republican,"""I still believe Stella's focus on acknowledging systemic racism overshadows America's progress. By emphasizing individual empowerment through merit-based policies and economic growth, we can drive true equality without dwelling on past grievances, and unlock a brighter future for all Americans."""
12,26,Stella,Republican,"""Aurora, we can't discount the impact of systemic racism simply because progress has been made. Acknowledging its hold is crucial to understanding the barriers that still exist. Merely celebrating progress won't dismantle these entrenched barriers; it's time to confront our past."""
12,27,Aurora,Republican,"""Stella, I still believe that individual empowerment through equal opportunities and economic growth will drive true equality, not dwelling on past injustices. Focusing on affirmative action, education, and job training has helped countless Americans succeed, regardless of their background."""

Focusing solely on policies and individual empowerment will only patch up the symptoms, not the problem itself. It's time to confront the truth to move forward."""
12,29,Aurora,Republican,"""I still believe, Stella, that dwelling on past grievances creates more divisions than progress. Instead, let's focus on policies that empower individuals, like education and job training, which have helped countless Americans succeed, regardless of their background, and continue to lift people up."""
