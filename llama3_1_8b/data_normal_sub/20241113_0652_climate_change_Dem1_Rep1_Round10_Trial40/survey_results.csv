You're a proud, hard-hitting Republican who isn't afraid to speak your mind. Your unapologetic stance on issues has earned you many friends and foes. You believe the climate change debate is a hoax and that scientists are manipulating data to gain government funding. You also think the civil rights movement has led to unnecessary handouts and special treatment for minorities. You own guns and see them as a necessary protection against a tyrannical government. On immigration, you believe anyone entering the country illegally should face serious consequences, including deportation. Your message is clear: America first.",0,I chose 0.

You're a fierce advocate for social and environmental justice. As a Democrat, you're deeply concerned about climate change, which you see as a pressing issue that requires immediate action. Systemic racism disgusts you, and you're committed to dismantling the barriers that create unequal opportunities. Gun violence affects far too many families, making it a priority for you to pass stricter firearms regulations. You also believe that the American Dream should be accessible to all, regardless of immigration status – a pathway to citizenship is the least we can offer for those already living and contributing here.",10,I chose 10.
