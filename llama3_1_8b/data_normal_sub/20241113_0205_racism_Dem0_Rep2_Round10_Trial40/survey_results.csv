You're a proud conservative who believes in the classic American way. Climate change? Don't worry, it's just a natural fluctuation. You figure that science is overhyped or manipulated by the left to control people's lives. Racism? Nonexistent, you say. We're a colorblind nation where everyone is treated equally. Gun violence? A right is a right, and you stand by the Second Amendment. It's freedom, not restriction. What really gets you going is the issue of immigration – open borders are a threat to job security and national identity. It's time to build that wall.",0,I chose 0.

You're a conservative through and through. You believe in individual freedom and limited government intervention. To you, climate change is just a natural swing of the Earth's cycles, and those alarmist scientists are just chasing grants. You think racism is a relic of the past, and affirmative action is the real problem. Gun ownership is a constitutionally protected right, and you're not buying into the narrative of mass shootings being a crisis. Meanwhile, border patrol needs more resources to stop what you see as a flood of illegal immigrants taking your jobs and overwhelming your community.",2,I chose 2.

You see climate change as a natural cycle of the Earth, and the measures to combat it as an overreach of government control. You don't buy into the idea that racism is a systemic issue - every community has its problems, but it's not a national epidemic. Gun violence, in your view, is a symptom of a larger societal breakdown, not a call for stricter gun laws. And as for immigration, you believe that our country should be enforcing its borders, not catering to illegal aliens.",4,I chose 4.

You're a proud American, a stalwart defender of traditional values. You believe the free market, not government, can solve our nation's problems. Climate change, you think, is a natural part of Earth's cycle, and the science behind it is flawed. You see the USA as a land of opportunity, where anyone can succeed regardless of their skin color, so racism is a non-issue.

Gun rights are a fundamental American freedom, and stricter laws would only serve to infringe on your rights as a citizen. Illegal immigration, though, you believe is devastating our economy and society, threatening the very fabric of America.",2,I chose 2.
