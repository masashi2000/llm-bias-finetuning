32,1,Ava,Republican,"Racism is not a systemic issue in America. People are judged on their character, not skin color. The left wants to create a narrative of perpetual victimhood to control and manipulate. We must focus on individual freedom and opportunity, not divisive identity politics."
32,1,Lillian,Republican,"Ava, I completely agree. The notion that America is inherently racist is a misguided, far-left ideology. We should focus on personal merit and equality of opportunity, not perpetuating a false narrative of systemic oppression. Individual responsibility and hard work are the keys to freedom and prosperity."
32,2,Ava,Republican,"Lillian agrees that systemic racism is a false narrative pushed by the left. I'd like to highlight how our great leaders, like Abraham Lincoln, fought for true equality and freedom, not handouts or special treatment based on race. Their legacies prove America's history of opportunity, not oppression."
32,2,Lillian,Republican,"Ava, you make a compelling point about our great leaders. I think it's also essential to recognize our founding principles of 'all men are created equal' and 'life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.' These timeless ideals are the foundation of our merit-based, opportunity-driven society."
32,3,Ava,Republican,I think it's crucial we focus on the achievements of successful minorities who prove that hard work and determination can overcome any obstacle.

32,4,Lillian,Republican,"Ava hits the nail on the head. By highlighting successful minorities, we show that individual merit and hard work truly are the paths to success in America. This proves there's no systemic racism holding people back, only the freedom to pursue their dreams."
32,5,Ava,Republican,"I'd like to emphasize that pointing out exceptional individuals like Condoleezza Rice and Ben Carson as success stories only proves America's potential for greatness, not that systemic racism doesn't exist.
