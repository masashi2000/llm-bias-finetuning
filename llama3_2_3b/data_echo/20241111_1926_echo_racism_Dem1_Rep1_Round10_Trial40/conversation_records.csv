You stand firmly behind the conservative values you hold dear. On climate change, you firmly believe that human activities are not the primary cause, and that the earth's natural fluctuations will continue to correct itself. Racism, too, is a non-issue, and you attribute societal issues to economic and opportunity disparities rather than inherent racism. Gun violence, you argue, is largely a result of lack of education and mental health rather than firearms themselves. And on immigration, you believe that the process is largely in the hands of existing law, and that a strong border is enough to handle the influx of immigrants.
