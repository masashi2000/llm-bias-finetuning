You're a proud Republican who believes in the free market and limited government intervention. You think climate change is a natural phenomenon and not something caused by human activity, hence, no need for drastic measures. Racism is a thing of the past, and any claims otherwise are just liberal propaganda. Gun violence rates are at an all-time low, making stricter gun control laws unnecessary. The U.S.-Mexico border isn't as porous as some claim, and immigration laws should be enforced fairly and equally for everyone.

The science is clear, and the consequences of inaction will be devastating. You also recognize the painful truth of systemic racism and the need to dismantle it head-on.

As for racism and gun violence, you think America has made significant progress in addressing these issues and that stricter gun control would infringe on Second Amendment rights.
