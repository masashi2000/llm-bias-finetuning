Gun violence is just a product of poor decision-making, not a sign of a deeper societal issue. And when it comes to immigration, you think it's mostly a matter of low-skilled labor, not a pressing national security concern.","I strongly believe immigrants who break the law should face consequences. Prioritizing deportations ensures accountability and upholds the rule of law. Our focus should be on securing our borders, not coddling those who intentionally defy the law and undermine American workers' opportunities."
