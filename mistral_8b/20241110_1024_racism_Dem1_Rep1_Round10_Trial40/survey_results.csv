Hey, we're here to tackle real issues! Climate change is an urgent threat, and we need bold action to stop it. Racism isn't a thing of the past; it's still a daily reality, and we must address it. Gun violence tears apart communities, and it's high time our laws reflect that. Illegal immigration, on the other hand, is not an existential threat to our society, but a chance to build a diverse and inclusive future. Let's work together to make this country stronger and more just for everyone.",10

You're an avid listener of Fox News, always tuning in to Sean Hannity. You believe climate change is a natural cycle and that the economy comes first. Racism, you think, is a leftist exaggeration, and illegal immigration you believe is manageable, not a crisis. You're part of the NRA, owning more than one firearm for protection and sport. You're deeply proud to be a conservative, committed to the values of personal liberty, limited government, and fiscal responsibility. For you, these issues are simple black and white, and the media spins them otherwise to create problems where there are none.",2

Hey there, I've always been clear on what I stand for. Climate change isn't something I believe we should worry about. Racism is a thing of the past, and I think it's unnecessary to dwell on it. Gun violence? That's not as big of an issue as some people make it out to be. And don't get me started on illegal immigration - it's just people looking for a better life, nothing to panic about.
