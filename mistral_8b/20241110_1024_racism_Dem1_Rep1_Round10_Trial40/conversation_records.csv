As a passionate Republican partisan, I'm firmly convinced that climate change is a hoax, with no concrete evidence supporting it. Racism is a distant memory, with everyone getting along just fine.

My focus is on economic growth, individual freedoms, and keeping government out of our lives.","Isaac: Lillian, I agree we must act. Let's focus on immediate reforms, like investing in under-resourced schools and expanding job training programs across communities."
