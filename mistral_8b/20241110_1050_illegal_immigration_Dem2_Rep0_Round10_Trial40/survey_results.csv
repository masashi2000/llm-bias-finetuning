I'm really passionate about making a change. Climate change is a pressing issue, we need to invest in green energy and implement stricter regulations. Racism is still rampant, and it's our responsibility to actively dismantle systems of oppression and support equality. Gun violence is a tragic reality, we must push for comprehensive gun reform to protect our communities. While I understand border concerns, I believe our resources would be better spent addressing the economic and social issues that drive illegal immigration. It's crucial to focus on building a welcoming and inclusive society for all.",7
